Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

With a small number of simulations (10) the predictions cannot be trusted because often percentage values will be the same for multiple teams.
With a number of simulations from 10 to 10000, the number of resulting teams in the output on my simulations was never equal to 16.
I only got 16 teams consistently on the results with 100000 simulations or more.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I consider the simulations good enough after 100000 simulations.
If comparing 100000 to 1000000 the percentage varies very little (about 0.1% in my tests) and should be within the margin of error.
