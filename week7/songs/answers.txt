>If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

We can calculate the audio aura for this given user by looking at the average energy, valence, and danceability with the following query:
`SELECT name, ROUND((energy + valence + danceability)/3,2) FROM songs;`
This query will output the averages (aura) rounded to two decimal places.

When the aura is high the songs might be characterized as energetic, positive, and lively.
While looking at this user aura, we can say that most of the values are higher than 0.5 so we can conclude that
they prefer music that is energetic, positive, and danceable as opposed to more calm songs.

>Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
We don't know the exact algorithm used by Spotify and the averages might not be representative as it smooths out extremes values.
While we have the top 100 most played songs, we don't know the exact number of plays for each one.
We should also note the variability and range in the auras. While the average trend leans towards higher scores (>0.5), there are songs with lower scores too.
